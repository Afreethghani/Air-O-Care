# Air-O-Care

To design an IOT based Air Pollution Monitoring System which used to monitor and analyse air quality real-time and log data to the cloud,keeping the data updated over the internet. Air quality measurements are taken based on the Parts per million metrics. In the present day, critical global issue is an air pollution which impacts negatively on the ecosystem, economy, and human health. The proposed system consists of sensors to sense harzardous gases,temperature and humidity persistently and send out results to embedded controller. A simple alert and LED is used to indicate exceed in hazardous gases.
